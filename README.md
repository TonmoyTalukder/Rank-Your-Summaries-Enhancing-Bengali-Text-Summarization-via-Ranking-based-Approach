# Rank-Your-Summaries-Enhancing-Bengali-Text-Summarization-via-Ranking-based-Approach
#### _Abstract_
As the demand for efficient and effective text summarization methods grows, it is important to explore ways to improve the quality and accuracy of pre-trained models for summarizing Bengali text. While pre-trained transformer models have shown great promise for natural language processing tasks, it is often challenging to determine which generated summary is the most informative and relevant for a given text. This is where our research comes in. By utilizing a ranking-based approach to compare the output of four different pre-trained Bengali text summarization models, we aim to identify the most accurate and informative summary for a given text. The process begins by carrying out preprocessing of the input text that involves eliminating unnecessary elements such as special characters and punctuation marks. Next, we utilize four pre-trained summarization models to create summaries, followed by applying a text ranking algorithm to identify the most suitable summary. Ultimately, the summary with the highest ranking score is chosen as the final one. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, the generated summaries are compared against human-annotated summaries using metrics such as \textit{BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER}, and \textit{METEOR} scores. Our experimental results suggest that by leveraging the strengths of each pre-trained transformer model and combining them using a ranking-based approach, our methodology significantly improves the accuracy and effectiveness of Bengali text summarization.
